# fish_prompt.fish
This is my customized fish_prompt.fish from `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish`

Please feel free to copy and use this custom fish prompt in your terminal.

I used "Simple Pythonista" as a base template and customized it to my liking.  You can find "Simple Pythonista" by typing the following command into terminal after fish is installed:
`$ fish_config`

A new browser window/tab should open and then select Prompt.  Thre you can also view many others that are aviailble.

Here's a screenshot of my customized propmpt:
